# Licensing Demo

A little project that uses:

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Axon Framework](https://axoniq.io/) for CQRS and Event Sourcing 
* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) via [GraphQL Java](https://www.graphql-java.com/)

I have created it to learn about these things and to support some of my work.

## Interface

The interface is all GraphQL and the running application exposes a [GraphiQL interface](http://localhost:8000/graphiql).

Alternatively, [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) has good GraphQL support. There is a [workspace
definition](insomnia/Insomnia-workspace_Licensing-Demo.json) that you can import into Insomnia to get started.
